### How did it all begin?

My wife and I started budgeting in earnest around five years ago in order to save enough for a planned Europe trip. This goal meant we needed to do two things. Firstly, we needed to make some tough decisions about what we were spending our money on (priorities). Secondly, it meant having some real visibility about what we were spending our money on each month, and how we were tracking towards our goal. Being an accountant in a public practice firm at the time, Excel was a natural (and free) choice.

Our budget developed over the course of several years as my Excel chops improved. From a *very* basic one sheet budget to a very well formatted multi-tab scripted process with supporting charts.
