A practical guide to constructing a personal budget system using spreadsheets


### How will I learn?

When I first started building my very own budget, there were things that I wanted to do that I thought should be obvious – these should be solved problems. I was able to find solutions to these problems, but they were scattered around the internet, and not directly applicable to my situation. I feel like there is value in a single source of information in how to use Excel effectively to build a personal budgeting spreadsheet.

I aim to take you through the stages that I went through when building my first budget – except instead of taking years of the budget to develop to a point of full maturity and usefulness, I will take you on the accelerated journey.

After each chapter, you will have gained a useful analysis tool or method that will make your budget more useful and robust even if you read no further. You can take your budget as far as you want to.
